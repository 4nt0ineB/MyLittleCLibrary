# MyLittleCLibrary
An ANSI C library gathering things I learned in college, to implement things faster for my homework and projects.

## Motivation

The idea of this library is to have shorthand use of certain structures.
It is a useful tool that allows me not to reinvent the wheel every time. 
A custom structure fitted to your needs will be more efficient because unwanted 
and heavy abstractions would be reduced, besides you'll know how it works. 
Word to the wise: it probably carries bugs and flaws.
