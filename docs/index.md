# My Little C Library
A static ANSI C library gathering things I learned in college.

I started to make this lib because, during a C project I was bored to reimplement same data structures over again
for different objects. I was convinced there must exist a way to juste simply write generic data structures.

But while working on it I realized few things:
- Genericity need abstraction. And the more you want a user to get rid of types manipulation
the more abstraction you'll need and the bigger the lib will be - and thus much more work.
- More abstraction mean lower performance

But hey I knew it. Tough it's quite interesting to experiment these limitation with a practical example.

Two quotes from computer scientists I read online illustrate the idea.
“Any problem in computer science can be solved by adding another layer of abstraction.” - David Wheeler
“Any performance problem in computer science can be solved by removing a layer of abstraction.” - Dave Clark

So, I think this lib could be ok to use for small projects or to visualize some data structures, while learning C
but not much more.
